        I have always loved technology ever since I was little. I messed around with command line when I was younger because I had a Tandy computer and no internet. lol! This is when I became very interested in tech. I can fix my own PC without having to take it anywhere else, unless it is something that I cannot fix.
        I try to keep with technology, but with tech always changing every 6 months or so it's kind of hard to keep up with everything.
