            I love to read books when I have the time. Some of my favorite books that I have read so far are the <a href="https://www.pccastauthor.com/house-of-night" target="_blank">House of Night</a> series by P.C. and Kristen Cast. Which is about a newly formed vampire trying to learn how to deal with the chnage she just went through. If you like vampire books that are NOT Twilight, this is a really good read, espcially for a young adult series.
            Another book that I loved was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one" target="_blank">Ready Player One </a>by Earnest Cline. I got this book in a Loot Crate box and immediately loved it. I geeked out with all of the video game refrencences!
